# Hypernet.ID

Hypernet.ID empowers you to safely and securely complete identity and Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. Once 
you pass the checks, a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is minted to your linked Ethereum account. Smart contracts of 
any dApp can then access the publicly available, non-transferrable NFT and interact with your account, helping 
to ensure that any transfer of value complies with applicable regulations. Once your account possesses a 
Hypernet.ID NFT, you will not have to go through the identity and KYC verification process again. Instead, you 
may interact with multiple dApps that each leverage your Hypernet.ID NFT to verify your status, rather than 
asking you to complete the same checks for each dApp.

As a developer, there are two primary ways to integrate Hypernet.ID into your dApp: in your dApp's UI and in your 
smart contract protocol itelf. 

## [UI integration package](/packages/web-integration)

A lightweight typscript package for interacting with the Hypernet.ID service in your web-based application.

## [Smart Contract Integration](/packages/contracts-integration)

A minimilist smart contract library for enforcing identiy verification at the protocol level.

# What is an NFT?

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital asset that exists on the blockchain. It can be owned and interacted with via the functionality provided by a crypto wallet. Simply put, an NFT consists of three parts: a contract address (the storage location on the blockchain), a token ID (a unique reference number within that storage location), and metadata (like a URL, or in the case of Hypernet.ID, binary flags indicating the presence of PII collected on the owner of the token).

**Why does Hypernet.ID give me an NFT?**

The NFT issued by Hypernet.ID is akin to a digital badge that indicates your account address belongs to an individual who has passed KYC/AML identity verification. The fact that this digital badge exists directly on the blockchain means that smart contracts on the blockchain can themselves verify that the account may conduct business allowed by the KYC and AML verifications. The Hypernet.ID NFT cannot be transferred to a new account address; this would negate the signature proof you are asked to sign in the onboarding procedure.

**How do I obtain my Hypernet.ID NFT?**

Step 1:

Make sure you have a cypto wallet and that your secret recovery phrase is stored somewhere safe in case of an emergency.

Step 2:

Visit the [Hypernet.ID](https://hyperkyc-dev.hypernetlabs.io) web application and click the Start button to agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

Step 6:

After you have completed Step 5, Jumio will process your identity check. Next, you will receive an email notification after your identity check has been processed. If you pass successfully, your account will receive a Hypernet.ID NFT. If your identity check failed, check the email from Jumio for next steps.

**What about the security of my PII?**

All personally identifiable information collected in Step 5 is stored securely by our identity verification partner, Jumio. Your Hypernet.ID NFT records contain absolutely no PII. Instead, your Hypernet.ID NFT only indicates whether or not a piece of information has been collected. Once you have a Hypernet.ID NFT to verify your identity, you no longer need to reveal PII again to any other third parties.

# How do I view my Hypernet.ID in my Mobile Wallet?

Some mobile wallets automatically detect when your account recieves an NFT asset (they do this by 
listing for blockchain [events](https://ethereum.org/lt/developers/docs/smart-contracts/anatomy/#events-and-logs) 
associated with your account). However, some mobile wallets (like Metamask) require that you import your NFT manually by inputing 
the address of the NFT contract and your unique token ID. 

## MetaMask Mobile

1. Open your Metamask wallet and make sure you are accessing the correct network (i.e. Mainnet, Rinkeby, Polygon mainnet, etc.). 
2. Make sure the account you registered with Hypernet.ID is the currently active account in the app.
3. Select the NFT subtab for the account and then click "import NFTs"
4. Paste the [contract address](/packages/contracts-integration/README.md#hypernet.id-registry-chain-addresses) for the network your wallet is configured for into the field called "Address".
5. Paste the token ID of your Hypernet.ID into the field called "ID".

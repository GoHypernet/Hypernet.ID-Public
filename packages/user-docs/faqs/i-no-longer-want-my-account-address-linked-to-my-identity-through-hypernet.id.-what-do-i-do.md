# I no longer want my account address linked to my identity through Hypernet.ID. What do I do?

Visit Hypernet LaunchPad [here](https://hypernet-protocol-dashboard-dev.hypernetlabs.io/registries/HyperID/entries). Sign in with the wallet address you no longer want to be linked to your identity and find the Hypernet.ID registry on the list of registries. Click on “Registry Entries”. You will be able to find your NFT on this page and then burn it.

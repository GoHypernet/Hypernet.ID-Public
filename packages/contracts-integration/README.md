# Smart Contract Integration

Hypernet.ID mints Non-Fungible Token assets directly to a user's account on the blockchain. This package allows 
protocol developers to gate access to their protocol by requiring that an account own a Hypernet.ID NFT and that 
it indicates the user has met certain identity check criteria.

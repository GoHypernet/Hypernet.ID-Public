# Hypernet.ID

Hypernet.ID empowers you to safely and securely complete Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) checks on your customers. Once 
the identity checks are passed, a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is minted to the customers' linked Ethereum account. Smart contracts of 
your dApp can then access the publicly available, non-transferrable NFT and interact with the customers' account, helping 
to ensure that any transfer of value complies with applicable regulations. Once the customers' account possesses a 
Hypernet.ID NFT, they will no longer have to go through the identity and KYC verification process again, unless you require periodic updates. 

All end users will be screened against global sanctions lists and adverse media for 365 days from the time of submission. To the extent an issue arises, Hypernet will burn the customre's NFT. If you desire to have continued screening beyond the 365 day period, please let us know and we will configure your account apropriately.

There are two primary ways to integrate Hypernet.ID into your dApp: in your dApp's web-based UI and in your 
smart contract protocol itelf. 

## [Web Integration](/packages/web-integration)
A lightweight typscript package for interacting with the Hypernet.ID service in your web-based application.

## [Smart Contract Integration](/packages/contracts-integration)
A minimilist smart contract library for enforcing identity verification at the protocol level.
